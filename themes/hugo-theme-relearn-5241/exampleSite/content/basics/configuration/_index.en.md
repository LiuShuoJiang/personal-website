On top of [Hugo's global configuration options](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/), the Relearn theme lets you define further options unique to the theme in your `hugo.toml`. The defaults are written in the comments of each option.

Note that some of these options are explained in detail in other sections of this documentation.

````toml {title="hugo.toml"}
